# Soundwave Visualizer

This project is inspired by Devin Crawford's LED Music Visualizer (https://github.com/DevonCrawford/LED-Music-Visualizer).
The goals of this project are to:
	- Connect to an arduino via bluetooth
	- Stream music curently playing to arduino
	- Create an RGB value based on song's current pitch and volume
	- Propagate RGB value down LED strip

Issues:
	- Finding a way to play music and read the frequency/send it out without stopping the music

Solutions:
	- Use a microphone to pick up freqencies
## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
Give examples
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

## Deployment

Add additional notes about how to deploy this on a live system
